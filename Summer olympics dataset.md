Summer-Olympics-Data-analysis(1976-2008)

The Olympic Games are the largest international sporting event, showcasing athletes from across the world competing in a wide variety of sports. This dataset contains historical Summer Olympic medal records from 1976 to 2008, including details such as athlete names, countries, sports, disciplines, events, and medal types.
Using this dataset, we explore medal counts by country, sports dominance, trends over the years, and apply machine learning techniques to predict whether an athlete is likely to win a medal based on attributes like country, sport, and discipline.

Motivation

The Olympic Games are a rich source of data for performance analysis. Understanding medal distributions helps uncover the dominance of countries across sports, emerging nations in specific events, consistency of top athletes and teams, and historical shifts due to political, social, or sporting developments (e.g.,East/West Germany → Germany).
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can reveal patterns in global sporting events and make data-driven predictions.

Libraries Used

1. numpy – mathematical operations & array handling
2. pandas – data cleaning, grouping, and transformations 
3. matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization 
4. scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, train/test split, model evaluation

Purpose

This dataset can be used to train a machine learning model to predict the probability of an athlete winning a medal based on features such as, country, sport, gender, year, previous medal counts
